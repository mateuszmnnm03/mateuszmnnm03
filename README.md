## Hi there 👋

My name is **Mateusz**, I am a **third-year Computer Science student at AGH University of Kraków**.  
I’m mainly interested in **algorithms, problem solving, machine learning, and mathematics**. Outside of university, I work as a **mathematics and programming tutor**, helping students prepare for exams and improve their skills.

Pinned project repositories below are my main completed projects:
- **Darwin Simulator** – simulation application with a **JavaFX frontend** and **Java backend**
- **University Database** – relational university database implemented in **SQL Server**
- **Polygon Triangulation** – implementation and analysis of polygon triangulation algorithms  
  (Delaunay triangulation, monotone polygon)
